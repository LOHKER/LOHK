LOHK has decided to use the base template provided by ICS 314 at UH Manoa. For details regarding the template, please click [here](http://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template-react/).

<b>What is complete thus far:</b>
- LOHK's password security is fully functional. There is a list of requirements that the password must meet prior to registration, and if they are not met, account creation is not available.
- The basic page layouts of LOHK has been created and connected. Each page is accessible and ready for front-end development.

<b>What is pending:</b>

- LOHK strives to create a dual authentication feature where post log-in, the user will be redirected to a page to input a pin that is sent to their email. The pin must match and if it does not, they can not access the dashboard to view their saved information.
- LOHK is still bare-bones when it comes to its front-end aesthetic. There is a lot of development that needs to be done to give LOHK the characteristics to stand out by itself as an application.
